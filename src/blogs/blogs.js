        content: 'In case one is clear that one wants to be truly  a  global executive (meaning acceptability and employability anywhere in the world) or desires to settle abroad then one should obtain MBA degree from USA. Reason  for suggesting USA is that in the foreseeable future their  economy is unlikely to go down. Hence, better scope of employability. Further, MBA degree of USA is acceptable worldwide whereas degrees of other countries are less likely to be accepted in the USA. Europe does have very good business schools but Indians loose out in terms of getting visa  or work permit for working in Europe. MBA from Singapore, HongKong, Manila and other good B-Schools from Asia and even Europe makes the person land up in good companies, quite often MNCs, in Singapore, Taiwan, Korea, HongKong, Indonesia, Philippines and Thailand etc. If one intends to do MBA as an academic pursuit to be followed by a doctoral degree then this does not hold good. One can go to study in any institution known for its area of excellence.'

        content: 'Indians wanting to settle down in India for social, personal or economy reasons should obtain MBA degree from a B-School of India. Indian employers always prefer an MBA from India because of relevance of course content to Indian conditions.They may accept very few from across the best in the world for number of reasons including cost to the company.'

        content: 'Should one settle for nothing but the Best? It is interesting to note that the kind of job offers made to, say, top 5% of the students in B-School ranking of 20 to 30 in USA are similar to the bottom 50% of the students in, say, top 7-8 ranking B-Schools in USA.In India too the story is not very different.It may not be a bad idea to get into a slightly lower ranking B-School rather than waiting longer to get into the best.'

        type: 'paragraph',
        content: 'Value add means the transformation of a person, i.e. improvement in knowledge, skills and attitude, during the period of doing MBA. This is a function of reputation, rigour and ambience of the institute, the quality of faculty, infrastructure and peer group. It also depends in a large measure on the attitude, aptitude, likings and prefernces of the student himself.'

      {
        type: 'paragraph',
        content: 'Return on investment may be seen  differently in USA and India. In USA MBA programmes will generally cost USD 150 K to USD 300K and on completion compensation packages are also in the region of USD 100 K to 200 K. Thus, taking a loan is almost a necessity. In India, the fee structure varies drastically even within different kinds of Universities and autonomous institutions like IIMs and IITs. While deciding a B-School this needs to be seen and evaluated closely.It may make much more sense to go to a slighly lower ranked B-School if the fee difference is large.'
