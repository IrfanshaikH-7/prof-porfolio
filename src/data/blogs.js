Reports from the World Economic Forum and Deloitte indicate that adaptability ranks as one of the most desired attributes by employers. By 2030, up to 30-40% of workers in developed countries may need to switch occupations or significantly upgrade their skill sets. The ability to pivot, embrace change, and learn new skills is crucial. Students can develop adaptability by engaging in diverse learning opportunities, taking courses outside their major, and pushing themselves out of their comfort zones with challenging projects or part-time jobs. Developing a habit of self-education through online courses, webinars, or certifications is also essential to keep skills updated in our fast-paced world.'

Components of emotional intelligence include self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. Developing these skills can lead to better job satisfaction and performance. The National Education Policy 2020 emphasizes the importance of education in equipping students with these necessary skills for future employability. Students can develop these skills by engaging in team projects, including interdisciplinary ones, and participating in student organizations to hone collaborative skills. Creating and practicing self-awareness through journaling or self-reflection exercises can help understand one\'s own emotions and triggers. Seeking feedback from peers, mentors, or professors is also crucial for improving interpersonal skills and self-awareness.'

In the 1980s and early 1990s, I worked in investment banking, dealing with IPOs, deals, and numbers, feeling the pulse of the financial markets every day.

But consulting is more than just providing solutions to immediate problems; it\'s about crafting strategic visions, streamlining operations, and driving innovation across every sector you can imagine. Today, as we stand in 2024, the global consulting market is valued at over $300 billion.

        content: 'Over-invoicing of goods or services can be used to make inflated insurance claims in the event of loss or damage. Businesses or individuals artificially inflate the value of goods insured and, when a claim is made, receive payouts far exceeding the true value. A company insures goods at an inflated value and then claims that they were lost or damaged in transit. The over-invoicing of the goods ensures a larger insurance payout than the actual loss incurred.'

        type: 'paragraph',
        content: 'Under-invoicing is used for financial fraud by deliberately declaring a lower value for goods or services, allowing businesses to evade customs duties, minimize tax liabilities, engage in capital flight, and support black market activities. When combined with over-invoicing, it creates a more sophisticated form of financial fraud, known as trade-based money laundering (TBML), where goods are under-invoiced on export and over-invoiced on import. This enables businesses to manipulate profits, evade taxes, shift funds across borders without detection, and engage in illicit financial activities. By alternating between under- and over-invoicing, companies can also manipulate commodity prices and obscure financial transactions to deceive regulators.'

Studies outside theology, law and medicine were then called "philosophy", due to the Renaissance conviction that real knowledge could be derived from empirical observation. Studies in what once was called philosophy are now classified as sciences and humanities. Hence, most disciplines, other than few like medicine and law, have their roots in Philosophy.

Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument, and systematic presentation. These methods facilitate the work of research. Philosophy helps in analyzing concepts, definitions, arguments, and problems. It also helps in synthesizing a variety of views or perspectives into one unified whole. Philosophical thinking strongly emphasizes clear formulation of ideas and problems, selection of relevant data, and objective methods for assessing ideas and proposals. It also emphasizes development of a sense of the new directions suggested by new hypotheses and questions one encounters while doing research. As the father of the field of logic Aristotle was the first to develop a formalized system for reasoning. He observed that the validity of any argument can be determined by its structure rather than its content. Aristotle claimed that a human\'s highest functioning must include reasoning.'

These words are now used to describe self-imposed isolation to prevent catching or transmitting an infectious disease. In the 1800s these were used in the context of countries which chose to detach themselves politically and economically from the rest of the world. PPE  i.e., personal protective equipment – dates from 1934. Social distancing, first used in 1957, was originally an attitude rather than a physical term, referring to an aloofness or deliberate attempt to distance oneself from others socially. Today, we all understand it as keeping a physical distance between ourselves and others to avoid infection. New Normal is a term in business and economics that refers to financial conditions following the financial crisis of 2007-2008 and the aftermath of the 2008–2012 global recession. The term has since been used in a variety of other contexts to imply that something which was previously abnormal has become commonplace. Infodemic is the outpouring of unsubstantiated media and online information relating to a crisis. The term was coined in 2003 for the SARS epidemic, but has also been used to describe the current proliferation of news around coronavirus.'

IIT Council is the apex body headed by the cabinet Minister of Human Resource Development of the central government and is composed of Chairmen of Boards of Governors of all IITs, Directors of all IITS, renowned scientists, engineers, educationists, policy makers and industrialists. This IIT Council takes all policy decisions which are common for all IITs for example admission policy and process. At the next level is Board of Governors (BoG) of individual IIT. This BoG is for taking policy decisions of the particular IIT. Chairman of BoG can be in a way compared with Chairman of Board of Directors of a company. The Director of an IIT is akin to Chief Executive Officer (CEO) who has to execute the decisions taken by the BoG where he is also one of the members.  This is not like university system where the Vice Chancellor is like Chairman cum Managing Director of a company i.e. he is heading the policy function as well as executive function. What goes on in all IITs collectively or similarly is also quite often called IIT System. IIT act empowers the Director of an IIT to appoint any number of Deputy Directors and Deans and delegate his powers to these functionaries. In university system Deans generally have advisory role and Vice Chancellors quite often do not have a provision to delegate their executive powers to the Deans. It is an interesting feature of IITs that whether it is Library or Hospital or Security the buck stops at Chairman, Advisory Committee of Library or Hospital or Security. This Chairman is a Professor. So the last points of controls are not left in the hands of non-teaching staff or functionaries. It improves the respectability of teachers and makes the system clean. This helps in reducing red tape in the institution. This has prevented IITs to go the way universities in the country have gone particularly state universities and private universities. There are no such power centres as the Chairmen of such Advisory Committees are appointed on rotational basis. This also prepares such Professors for subsequent academic leadership roles.'

As a practice in entire IIT system answer-sheets are shown to the students without fail before the result is finalized.  And the student is free to discuss the assessment made by the teacher with him. Interestingly there is no Controller of Examination in IITs as there is no need for that. Results are compiled, computed and declared at the level of Assistant Registrar or Deputy Registrar under the guidance of Dean Academics.  No teacher leaves his class for attending meetings which is so common in most educational institutions. In most of the IITs even the Director loves to take classes to remain in touch with the subject, the students and to set an example for others. Most of the authorities like Deans and Associate Deans etc. fix up their classes in the forenoon session so that they can attend to administrative responsibilities in the afternoon and evening.

The period of observation could be keeping in mind the time which both the individuals are likely to spend at the same place.

For example it is easiest to talk about the latest mobile apps for smart phones to a teenager or a youngster, latest games on mobile phone to kids, helping out a lady or an old man in handling their electronic gadget like I pad or smart phone. In air travel, say by business class, one could initiate the talk on economy or some thing from National Geographic or Time magazine etc. The opening of a dialogue could be with a query, which is most common. Quite often one tests the water by asking questions relating to destination, if travelling or enquiring about the locality in which the other person stays etc. The response to such questions helps to decide the speed and style of further communication. With a lady, easier course could be to open the dialogue by guarded admiration of may be her dress, the make up or personal accessories like watch or purse or jewelry. One has to be careful in terms of the age difference between the two parties getting into conversation.

If that be the case student should find out the basic inclination and interest in the first year and then take the call. Historically the CEOs in business world come from marketing and finance functions as they are perceived to be contributing to and affecting the top line and bottom line of the business. Hence if it is a single specialisation one may, unless there are reasons otherwise, opt for either marketing or finance. In case of two specialisations are permitted one may opt atleast for one of these two. This is more so in the case of younger,aspirants, fresh or with less experience. These are core functions of business and campus placement employability is enhanced. Operations, particularly supply chain area has emerged very strong in recent years. For engineers, particularly those not enthused by marketing or finance, operations in general and supply chain in particular makes good sense. HR is not taken very seriously as there are few examples of people having made their mark in the corporate world. Female students with non engineering, non quant background prefer HR.'

The winner takes it all and the loser is left with a feeling of loss. “Healthy Competition” term is used when positive flavor is to be given to the term “Competition”. It is for the losers to first understand and appreciate the reasons for not winning and then work on strategies and practice to win.

The opportunities to collaborate at work place, in professional, social and personal space, with associates, relatives and friends are numerous. Collaboration needs to be well thought through before being initiated. One needs to know the purpose, people and the time frame before one gets into collaborative frameworks. Cooperation is a natural corollary and a requirement for collaboration. There may be a number of situations where one cooperates without collaborating, for example, cooperation with the boss, the colleagues and the subordinates at workplace, with the siblings at home and with class fellows in school or college. Cooperation creates goodwill and synergy. It increases the speed of learning. When one cooperates one feels good. When one feels good, the learning process expedites. When one learns, one feels happy. Again when happy one cooperates further and learns faster and feels happier. This is a cycle. Collaboration and cooperation create better environment for the happiness and growth of the people involved in the process. The happier the person more he or she contributes to the common good. While doing so, the person grows glows and shines. This may be a much better and easier process of personal growth than competition. Success through competition may evoke a temporary feeling of success but success through collaboration and cooperation evokes a longer lasting feeling. This is akin to increasing the size of the cake itself rather than fighting for the slices of the same cake.'

If one travels in first or business class (job profile, status and occasion determines that), the person sitting next may like to break the ice by talking about golf or wine. This is very common. It is important to know the basic rules of golf, knowledge of golf courses, producers of and types of golf kits, knowledge of golf accessories, best known golf course designers and knowledge of best golf courses around the world. Likewise basic knowledge of red, white and sparkling wine is a must and which vineyards are associated with the famous wines.

Others who may not be in the business or corporate world should keep abreast with the latest appearing in Time, National Geographic etc. In order to select the books for this purpose, one can see the current best sellers as well as all time classics being sold at book shops at international airports and the books being reviewed in the best of the magazines and newspapers.'

Sometimes it may be beneficial or advantageous to initiate discussion on topics like future, futurology or mega trends or emerging trends in technology or lifestyles or any such subject of general interest. This does give a leeway and a good beginning to open a dialogue specifically if you want to get started with a stranger. Political topics should generally be avoided as one does not know the leanings of the other person. And it may be likely that the other person is much more knowledgeable than the person initiating the dialogue. In such case the targeted person does not see any value add and may consider it to be waste of his time and may completely shut off. This may result in complete loss of opportunity to begin with. Hence, the opening of a dialogue should be on a topic of very general interest including some time topic like weather. The art of conversation lies in finding out what interests the other person and initiate and keep the discussion centered on that topic.'

Reaching very early may become a pain for the host and reaching late smacks of arrogance or indiscipline. One should give the gift immediately on arrival; this marks the presence and attendance both, of the invitee. Gift must be chosen very carefully in line with the taste and status of the host as also the occasion. In case of doubt a bouquet of flowers may be the best choice. Timely entry also helps if one plans to leave early or in case of an exigency very early. It is a good practice to wish and say goodbye to the host before leaving. One should also admire the arrangements at the party and the food served unless it was really terrible. No serious business should be discussed during the party except with your boss or colleagues if necessary or if you do not have anything else to do. Small introductions with people being met for the first time are the main advantage of attending such events. One should get to know who is who in such parties either directly or indirectly. The dress for the parties should be conservative decent unless a theme dress is prescribed for the party. It is only celebrities who may take their own call as far as party dress is concerned. The host also can decide to dress the way he or she likes. If one is organising a party be one should be careful about the date, venue, timings and the dress code to be prescribed. The list of invitees should be carefully prepared. It’s advisable not to mix two different types of group/s in the same party. Quite often people in different groups are not comfortable with each other and tend to remain in their own circle. As a host one has to ensure that no guest, irrespective of social status and standing of the guest, feels ignored, avoided or left out. It is better not to invite than to make the guest feel insulted. The host should continuously keep moving at the party venue and make sure that he or she is easily accessible to all the guests. He or she should spend good time at entry and exit points of the venue at least for thirty to forty minutes in the beginning and at the end of the party to welcome and send off the guests.'

Networking is not making 600 + contacts on Facebook and spending a lot of time updating status three times a day or uploading all personal or family photographs (a lot more discretion is required in this, more people have suffered than benefitted).  Networking is also not getting connected to 300+ contacts on LinkedIn and often writing individually or publicly that one is looking for a change of job, sometimes damaging good contacts in the process.'

For example, a friend goes for a morning walk in the company of people living in his residential area, most of them happen to be businessmen, including well to do shopkeepers. He has another group of school time friends. Yet another group of friends is of classmates and batch mates of his engineering college days. Then another group of his MBA class fellows, alumni and teachers. Friends, who   were in the first batch with him as young bank officers and many others, whom he met in later part of his banking career, he remains in touch with selected few from this group also as his “network”. These are some of the groups, I am aware of. He may have other groups like relatives or that of his wife who is a teacher. I have never seen him missing marriages and other parties. He uses these occasions   to establish and reunite with multiple contacts He also meets people in smaller groups. At the age of sixty three, he maintains active personal, social and professional life and continues to nurture it with his network of “networks”.'
