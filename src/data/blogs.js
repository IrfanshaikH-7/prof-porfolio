Reports from the World Economic Forum and Deloitte indicate that adaptability ranks as one of the most desired attributes by employers. By 2030, up to 30-40% of workers in developed countries may need to switch occupations or significantly upgrade their skill sets. The ability to pivot, embrace change, and learn new skills is crucial. Students can develop adaptability by engaging in diverse learning opportunities, taking courses outside their major, and pushing themselves out of their comfort zones with challenging projects or part-time jobs. Developing a habit of self-education through online courses, webinars, or certifications is also essential to keep skills updated in our fast-paced world.'

Harvard Business Review articles and reports from the World Economic Forum link emotional intelligence with leadership and team success. Components of emotional intelligence include self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. Developing these skills can lead to better job satisfaction and performance. The National Education Policy 2020 emphasizes the importance of education in equipping students with these necessary skills for future employability. Students can develop these skills by engaging in team projects, including interdisciplinary ones, and participating in student organizations to hone collaborative skills. Creating and practicing self-awareness through journaling or self-reflection exercises can help understand one\'s own emotions and triggers. Seeking feedback from peers, mentors, or professors is also crucial for improving interpersonal skills and self-awareness.'

In the 1980s and early 1990s, I worked in investment banking, dealing with IPOs, deals, and numbers, feeling the pulse of the financial markets every day.

It\'s about sitting down with organizations—whether they are businesses, governments, or even startups—and guiding them through some of their toughest challenges. But consulting is more than just providing solutions to immediate problems; it\'s about crafting strategic visions, streamlining operations, and driving innovation across every sector you can imagine. Today, as we stand in 2024, the global consulting market is valued at over $300 billion.

First and foremost, digital transformation—companies are rapidly embracing technologies like cloud computing, AI, and automation. Then there\'s the growing complexity of regulatory environments, which means that businesses need guidance to navigate through compliance and governance issues.

        content: 'Over-invoicing of goods or services can be used to make inflated insurance claims in the event of loss or damage. Businesses or individuals artificially inflate the value of goods insured and, when a claim is made, receive payouts far exceeding the true value. A company insures goods at an inflated value and then claims that they were lost or damaged in transit. The over-invoicing of the goods ensures a larger insurance payout than the actual loss incurred.'

        type: 'paragraph',
        content: 'Under-invoicing is used for financial fraud by deliberately declaring a lower value for goods or services, allowing businesses to evade customs duties, minimize tax liabilities, engage in capital flight, and support black market activities. When combined with over-invoicing, it creates a more sophisticated form of financial fraud, known as trade-based money laundering (TBML), where goods are under-invoiced on export and over-invoiced on import. This enables businesses to manipulate profits, evade taxes, shift funds across borders without detection, and engage in illicit financial activities. By alternating between under- and over-invoicing, companies can also manipulate commodity prices and obscure financial transactions to deceive regulators.'

On the right-hand side, there was a crank handle that one had to rotate to input numbers and arithmetic symbols like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (×), and division (÷).'
