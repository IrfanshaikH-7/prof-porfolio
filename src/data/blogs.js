          content: 'In case one is clear that one wants to be truly  a  global executive (meaning acceptability and employability anywhere in the world) or desires to settle abroad then one should obtain MBA degree from USA. Reason  for suggesting USA is that in the foreseeable future their  economy is unlikely to go down. Hence, better scope of employability. Further, MBA degree of USA is acceptable worldwide whereas degrees of other countries are less likely to be accepted in the USA. Europe does have very good business schools but Indians loose out in terms of getting visa  or work permit for working in Europe. MBA from Singapore, HongKong, Manila and other good B-Schools from Asia and even Europe makes the person land up in good companies, quite often MNCs, in Singapore, Taiwan, Korea, HongKong, Indonesia, Philippines and Thailand etc. If one intends to do MBA as an academic pursuit to be followed by a doctoral degree then this does not hold good. One can go to study in any institution known for its area of excellence.'

It is interesting to note that the kind of job offers made to, say, top 5% of the students in B-School ranking of 20 to 30 in USA are similar to the bottom 50% of the students in, say, top 7-8 ranking B-Schools in USA.In India too the story is not very different.It may not be a bad idea to get into a slightly lower ranking B-School rather than waiting longer to get into the best.'

This is a function of reputation, rigour and ambience of the institute, the quality of faculty, infrastructure and peer group. It also depends in a large measure on the attitude, aptitude, likings and prefernces of the student himself.'

In USA MBA programmes will generally cost USD 150 K to USD 300K and on completion compensation packages are also in the region of USD 100 K to 200 K. Thus, taking a loan is almost a necessity. In India, the fee structure varies drastically even within different kinds of Universities and autonomous institutions like IIMs and IITs. While deciding a B-School this needs to be seen and evaluated closely.It may make much more sense to go to a slighly lower ranked B-School if the fee difference is large.'

The vice vesa is also true. If one can anticipate market conditions one can get in for higher education at a time when economy is going througha lean phase.'

They were designed as an expansion of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), applying universally to both developing and developed nations. With 17 goals and 169 targets, the SDGs emphasize the interconnectedness of economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental protection, aiming to build a framework for progress that doesn\'t compromise the future. Their origin traces back to global discussions on sustainable development, starting from the Rio Earth Summit (1992) to the Millennium Summit (2000).'

On a global scale, only 16% of the SDG targets are on track to be achieved, while 84% show either limited progress or regression. Setbacks have been most pronounced in areas such as Zero Hunger (SDG 2), Climate Action (SDG 13), and Sustainable Cities (SDG 11). Progress has slowed since 2020, due to compounded crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and increasingly severe climate-related disasters.'

For example, India has made significant strides in renewable energy and poverty reduction, but continues to grapple with inequality, malnutrition, and healthcare infrastructure challenges. Meanwhile, the poorest nations, including Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and many African countries, face the most substantial setbacks. The widening gap between wealthy and vulnerable nations highlights the barriers to achieving global SDG success.'

Developing nations struggle to access long-term capital necessary for investments in healthcare, education, infrastructure, and climate adaptation. The SDR 2024 advocates for global financial reforms, including new forms of global taxation, such as taxes on international financial transactions, and calls for international debt relief for the most vulnerable nations.',
            'Ineffective Global Cooperation: Multilateral cooperation has failed to address rising geopolitical tensions and climate crises effectively. This lack of cooperation is particularly evident in the areas of Climate Action (SDG 13) and Peace and Justice (SDG 16). The SDR 2024 emphasizes the need for a more inclusive and effective global governance system that can address these challenges and guide global SDG efforts.',

The increasing frequency of extreme weather events and rising carbon emissions are undermining environmental goals. Sachs warns that without urgent and large-scale investments in renewable energy, the world will miss the Paris Agreement targets, which are essential for SDG success.',
            'Data Gaps and Monitoring Systems: A significant challenge in SDG implementation is the lack of robust data systems for tracking progress. Many low-income countries lack the infrastructure to collect high-quality, timely data, limiting evidence-based policymaking and progress evaluation. The SDR 2024 calls for greater investments in data infrastructure, especially in developing nations.'
