Above all, a great human being, a pleasing personality, and all other characteristics that is unique about this personality. His contribution to DOMS IITR and IITR cannot be explained in words as he was always busy with one or another project and keeps things moving.

What comes through is an uncompromisingly pragmatic, impeccably honest, multi-faceted person that one can never claim to know enough! Just when about everyone appeared prejudiced and opinionated against a business entity trying to establish a university, Dr. Nangia came upon us as a wave of fresh air. I think his grinding into the real world of banking and industry differentiated him from the rest. He had this uncanny knack to swim against the current. Right since inception, his ability to associate, to hold hand, to mentor, to contribute and to 'get things done' has been phenomenal. He would travel in impossible time frames to attend our meetings and help us establish our processes, sit as an expert during interviews, guide the directors and their teams in curating the syllabi; all this and more with a studied modesty, notwithstanding his larger-than-life stature at IIT Roorkee. Among his professional attributes, his in-depth mastery on matters of applied finance makes him a highly resourceful faculty for his students, and a very bankable counselor for his recipients like me, as he would always have a keen eye on the possible resource constraints whenever he would suggest any course of action. I have also been delightfully privy to his mastery in interview skills on numerous occasions. It is not without a reason that he has often served on the interview panels of the UPSC for the civil services. Generally, in first three minutes he would know whether to proceed further with the interview or not. He has this awesome ability to see through people. When most members on the panel thought that the candidate looked satisfactory, he would rip through the person with his reasons and also vice versa. A background check would almost invariably prove him right! Today, as the Chancellor of Quantum University, I realise that I have been fortunate to have Prof. Nangia in the proximity at IIT Roorkee, and to have been mentored by him from the very early stage. His participation comes in handy at every stage and continues to guide me through the maze.",

Not only can one learn from his areas of professional expertise but also from how he manages his life on various other fronts; of health and of joys of life. He's very intense about everything he does-be it happiness or anger. His regimens to cure himself from a life threatening disease and to join back his duty were extraordinary incidents of his life. He maintained an intense professor schedule by day and a happy and disciplined approach to wrestle with the challenges of life. He is still on move; making his post retirement time more creative, more impactful, and filled with more learning and joy. I must salute Nangia Sir for his insight, perspective, and candour.",

He provided me a different perspective to look at my options, and weigh the pros and cons associated with them. His suggestions are always customized to one's background, interests and requirements. His guidance pushed me to think about what would work best for me, rather than what looks appealing from the outside.",

These experiences and the leadership skills I imbibed working under his guidance still help me today and will continue to do so for the rest of my life. He has had immense impact on generations of students and I can only imagine the amount of cumulative impact his efforts have created in this world! Thank you for everything Prof. Nangia! You have been a true inspiration and I certainly hope to pay it forward!",

I feel very blessed that he guided me during my formative years, encouraged me to try new things, travel abroad, and go for a foreign education and value happiness. A strong proponent of practice based curriculum and education, I worked under him on the MHRD sponsored Knowledge Economy project and produced three research papers. That was a huge learning curve for me and something I thoroughly enjoyed doing under him. Some other activities I did under him include co-founding a student led active learning community, Group for Interactive Learning, participating in Acara Entrepreneurship Fellowship and working in group for better understanding the nuances of various English words for communication. He was very instrumental in helping me decide geography and universities for pursuing post-graduate education, and he groomed me through during my business school applications and interviews. A generous human being, a philosopher and a visionary, we often took long walks together and they are my most cherished memories of spending time with him. These days we keep in touch on and off, and he always keeps an eye out for my well-being, like my parents do.",

I came to IIT Roorkee campus as a young and a naive 16-year old boy with lots of dreams. Prof. Nangia sharpened my rough edges – from interpersonal communication to writing effective emails. He also taught me to think structurally, a skill that has served me well throughout my career. When I was a student, I used to hate how he would pick up on little things – wrong use of grammar, my speaking skills, and among other things, not coming prepared for the meetings. But, at the end of the day, he pushed us to our limits and wanted us to pay importance to these little things that, in my honest opinion, make all the difference between leaders and followers in the long run. There are teachers who teach you the coursework very well but then there are teachers like Prof Nangia who go beyond – they work with you to make you a rounded person. I began to see how I was better trained under his guidance when I set my foot into the modern work culture and how all of it mattered. I actually ended up thanking him for being harsh on me. \"Thank you for all your nit-picking. I couldn't have asked for a better mentor.\" I think those were my exact words. I will take this opportunity to thank him again for vesting his time in me. Thank you for picking me, Sir. I hope to make you proud one day.",

I still clearly remember the first time I met Prof. Nangia. I, along with 20 other fresher year students, waited eagerly for him to join us in the conference room. As he authoritatively walked into the room, everyone was awestruck by his charming presence. He inspired us with his strong leadership and captivating conversation in his first address itself. Prof. Nangia is full of energy and has a very strong work ethic. I was lucky to have worked with him throughout my 5 year time at IIT Roorkee. I learnt from him the art of communication (both verbal and written) and was able to work on and develop my leadership skills under his guidance. His exuberance always has and continues to motivate me to push harder. With his vast experience in banking, finance, education and governance, he groomed us into well-rounded individuals. I was therefore able to expand my interpersonal skills and learned to balance relational, professional and creative areas of my life. Above all, he developed in me a positive mindset and inculcate the right kind of attitude which changed the way I approached my problems. Like many others, I too was very confused and was struggling to figure out my career at the end of my pre-final semester. Prof. Nangia advised me to pursue higher studies and suggested exploring the new field of Data Science and Analytics. His immense experience and expertise in the field of education helped me plan my masters in the United States. Within a short period of time, I was able to figure out the courses, universities, application, letter of recommendation and finances. Moving to US for Master's remains one of the best decisions that I have taken thus far, and it truly paid. I shall forever remain indebted to him for his invaluable time and mentorship. I wish Prof. Nangia the best of health and life. And I hope to continue learning from him.",

He is a thorough professional who would prefer to understand the situation well, from different perspectives, before commencing any work on it. Being the HOD of an emerging department (DOMS) in IIT Roorkee comes with its own set of challenges. With Prof being at the helm of affairs, it was always easy for students, and other stakeholders, to sail through the journey with focus on their respective areas while the department related challenges, operations and strategic matters were well led by Prof Nangia seamlessly. I personally respect him for his approach based on Learning through Experiments in life; a person who believes in being amongst the early ones to try so that even if one fails, one learns early and then can perform to outclass many others. It's his approach that once made me feel (during my MBA times in IIT Roorkee when Prof Nangia was our HOD) if we will be left with things for us to work upon, considering the pace he would move ahead with. He always gave us a sense of being competitive in everything we do. A blend of a strict elderly person for all key aspects in our life, and a cool friend in all times of fun, is how I shall summarize him. Always look forward to a mentor, a friend and something beyond that, in him.",

With extreme curiosity and intrigue Prof. Nangia asked me about my intentions for joining as a researcher inspite of having a current successful career and a good posting as a Chief Conservator of Forest in my home state. I was not well prepared to reply exactly to what he intended to know. He kept me thoroughly engaged by asking many more questions about my working conditions, nature of work, future prospects of the service and so on. It was a 30 minutes meeting and when I came out from his office I had decided that I will certainly do my research work from this place only. The very determination to do so was the hypnotic personality and the knowledge depth of Prof. Nangia, which influenced me so deeply that I really wish to own few traits of him.\n\nThough it was not mandatory for me to be in his classes but I intentionally attended some of it and I found his talks so useful, functional, practical and factual that till date I have an audio copy of that which I keep on listening to refresh my memory. His orations are full of knowledge which provides theoretical as well as practical understanding of a subject. Facts and information shared by him simply shows his exceptional skills acquired through experience and education. I find his punctuality, sincerity and honesty to the class as remarkable and uncommon.\n\nWhile doing my PhD, he truly inspired me to work as a researcher by leaving the backdrops of my bureaucratic setups which inherently, I had attained during the course of my last 24 years as an Indian Forest Service Officer. He always showed me a perfect way out wherever I found myself in a fix. I earnestly appreciate his humility, precise guidance and a selfless genuine concern during my research work in the Department of Management Studies.\n\nProfessor Nangia shall always remain a constantly inspiring and influencing personality for me. His juvenile, sporting and stress relieving temperament really motivate me to proceed more systematically and meticulously in my life. I can never forget his pivotal role in my personal and academic life.\n\nHe owns a distinguished style, perfect attire, a charismatic personality, a compassionate heart and a sacred soul.

Dr. Nangia has given us an encouraging feedback on our venture, and has also offered constructive advice to help with business growth. His suggestions have always been well-suited to our business model and requirements. His advice has also never been prescriptive, which has given us the flexibility to build the business as per our vision. Dr. Nangia has a deep understanding of finance, business valuation, financial statements, accounting, company law and also how brands function. To point out a particular incident- we were able to navigate through structural hurdles in our business within a week after seeking his advice. Wherever Dr. Nangia felt we would benefit from an external source, he has time and again put us in touch with thought-leaders from various industries to guide us along the way. We have reached a point in our startup journey where we have been able to secure the interest of potential investors, and for this we are extremely grateful to Dr. Nangia and his vast wealth of knowledge, and highly recommend working with him.",

Your mentorship for last 4 years has been very crucial for us. Your precise advice, impeccable understanding of situations and enormous experience has helped us solve so many problems that came our way. There have been a lot of times when we lacked courage to take a particular decision but your encouragement helped us overcome our fears and made us believe in ourselves all over again. Obviously your financials and legal understanding is second to none and it has helped us understand so many difficult legal things and make the right decision for us. Your strength of connecting us to right people has been very fruitful for us. Thank you so much for always being there for us, trusting us, guiding us and helping us reach our true potential.

      description: "I am very happy to write this note of recommendation for a man I have now known for nearly 15 years. Prof Vinay Nangia was heading the Department of Management Science at IIT Roorkee when I met him first. He came across to me as a strongly ethical, straightforward, humble and compassionate man. As its Founding Head, he had imbued the DMS, IIT Roorkee with a unique culture of meritocracy, industry relevance and practical learning. He invited me to the campus to address his students soon after we had met. I loved his direct, mince-no-words, humorous approach to life and work, and we hit it off very well. I could easily sense his love for his job, the deep respect he drew from his faculty members and the love he had for his doting students. His past industry experience had no doubt stood him in good stead in his academic avatar too! As years passed, we stayed in touch, meeting at seminars, symposia and alumni events. We discovered many common friends, both in industry and academia. Being humble to the core, he is very averse to name dropping out of context, so one only gets to know of his wide and deep network of professional contacts when one spends time talking to him. He has always found time for his students, mentees and friends. His easy going nature and friendly smile hide a tough, no-nonsense professional who has no fear in speaking truth to power. In a nutshell, he represents the epitome of excellence in life and work, and it is a privilege to count him as a senior friend and mentor. We got to work closely again more recently, when he took charge of the newly started MBA/BBA programmes at the NSUT, Dwarka, New Delhi. I saw him burn the midnight oil in visioning, strategizing and implementing the pioneering course - MBA in Innovation, Entrepreneurship & Venture Creation - in a short time span of 4 months. Prof Nangia has been a constant source of guidance and inspiration in this recent association as well. Needless to say, Prof Nangia has served society widely and passionately all his working life, and at this stage in his life, is entitled to some relaxing times. Yet, he continues to spend a lot of quality time in helping the academic and entrepreneurship ecosystems across India. Being a simple man with a vastly rich experience, he is very sought after by universities and HEIs for their Management Boards, Selection Panels and Academic Councils. I would strongly recommend Prof Nangia for any such role as cited above.",

Prof Nangia is a true friend who not only helped and advised me during my startup business at Pathfinder Consultants, A management and human resources development recruitment, training and placement Company in the era of Y2K. Later, I was actively involved with Prof Nangia when he joined as the first Prof of the Department of Management Studies. Prof Nangia is a very fun loving and most admired friend, teacher, friend, mentor and guide. He is more of a valued friend to most of the students than a professor. He not only mentors them but also facilitates in their career building at every stage of the life. Prof Nangia is an excellent financial planner with his vast knowledge in Banking, Finance and business management. He is an excellent networking person and connects always dots to help and support others.",

I am privileged to have Sir as my professor, mentor and advisor. I met several students from IITs and IIMs who are a great admirer of Sir. His reputation precedes him. He is immensely revered in academic and corporate world. His knowledge and experience in academic finance and banking is outstanding. He is known for making complex lessons simpler. His teaching style has set an unbreakable benchmark at every institution where he has served. If you are a student of Prof. Nangia, you do not require LOR. If you wish to meet him, you must approach him with a unique and innovative idea. To guarantee your second meeting with him, you must achieve the set goal. He loves to turbocharge the best in the class engine so never ask a favour and must set your standard of performance high before meeting him. He is a man with the endless network in academia, corporate, civil services etc. He has helped me in getting the right people for the right job several times. He has guided me in making business model for my startup. He has helped me in company formation and taught me the importance of networking, documentation and report writing. The most important lesson I learned from Sir is the communication skill which has helped me in getting my company tied up with almost all top FMCG companies like Dabur, ITC, Nestle, Colgate, Adani, HUL, Emami, MTR, S C Johanson, Tata sons, Reckitt and Benckiser, Godrej, Cadbury etc in India. He never hesitates to share his invaluable connection for the accomplishment of the job. Your association with the professor is half work done for your success. I am truly grateful for his mentorship.",
